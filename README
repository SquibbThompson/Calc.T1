Limitations
Computational Complexity: The underlying method, spi.quad, uses adaptive quadrature, which generally has complexity 

O(nlogn), where 

n is the number of evaluations.
Precision and Stability: The result may suffer from numerical instability for highly oscillatory or singular functions.


Security: The use of eval may expose vulnerabilities, even with safety measures. 
(this one was auto generated which despite this perhaps **too meta analysis is still unclear why methodologically...)
~No doubt curious output for such a begnign tool imo: but I typically use GPT for writing limitations 
(at the risk of eyerolling density...itself a limitation and bias.)

General Notes
Both tools rely on numerical methods, so they are approximate solutions and may not always be suitable for functions that require high precision.
The tools are designed for interactive use and prompt the user for input. They may need to be adapted for use in a broader application or automation.
Both tools are specific to univariate functions, despite the name "Cursory Integrate Multivariate." The "multivariate" aspect refers to handling multiple functions rather than a true multivariate integration.
Feel free to reach out if you need further clarification or if you'd like to explore specific aspects in more detail!

I will , I mean whoops  : 0 (just kidding)

Console example:

# User inputs:
# Enter function in terms of x: sin(x)
# Enter the lower limit of integration: 0
# Enter the upper limit of integration: 1.25
# Enter the number of decimal places for the result: 2
# Output: The integral value is: ***
